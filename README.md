# AdvetntureWork-Bike-Sales-Analysis

I am presenting my Power BI Project, analyzing the sales of AdventureWorks Bike Shop.
The following are the details about the project, company's overview, the step that are being followed throughout the project.
AdventureWorks Bike Shop is a fictional global manufacturing company that produces cycling equipment and accessories.

With the help of this powerful report we can help the management team in tracking company's KPIs, things like sales, revenue, profit and returns, compare performance across regions, analyze product-level trends, and identify high-value customers.

## Following steps have been followed in creating this Report :-

1st STEP- First of all, for the beginning all we have is a folder of raw CSV files, which contain information about transaction and return records, products, customers, and sales territories.

2nd STEP- I have connected and transform that raw data and build a relational data model.

3rd STEP- I have Created calculated columns and measures with DAX.

4th STEP- Finally, I have designed an interactive dashboard to help visualize and analyze that data.	

You can see we've got those high level KPIs that the leadership team cares about, revenue, profit, orders, and return rate.
We've got a nice weekly revenue trending chart here as well.
And you'll see some really cool interactive elements that Power BI offers like sliders to zoom in on specific time periods, custom tool tips, and even a completely custom filter pane as well.
we can drill into any specific product to take us to our product detail view, that's gonna show us things like how a product is performing against its monthly order, revenue, or profit target.
